# Services-Nearby

This application will help you quickly and conveniently find the right service or service

The "services nearby" project is a service that combines information about various services, such as:


•photographer's services 

•Printing services

•Repair workshop services

•Car service services

•Medical services

•gas stations nearby

•Sewing ateliers nearby

•Nearest cafes and restaurants

•And many other things

How does it work? A person opens an application or website, on the main page he is looking for the necessary service or can use the search. Then it is transferred to the next page, where the possible variants are arranged in order. On this page on the right there will be a small map, where all places for the performance of a specific service (which the user has chosen) will be marked, and on the left there will be a stack of blocks. Each block will contain the name of the company, average rating and work schedule. When you click on the necessary block, detailed information about the company and the service itself will be displayed: reviews, rating, work schedule, phone numbers, photos. This project will be very useful for people who often cannot find what they need on the Internet.


What is this service for?
Often, when searching for the necessary service in various browsers, they give out information about only a small part of the companies that can provide you with the necessary service. Usually there is no information about the cost of services, work schedule and reviews. Thus, people do not find the service they need.

Example: 

The client needs the service of a photographer

The client visits the website/application and writes "photographer's services" in the search for services
=>
The website provides information about all the services of the photographer in the city on the map
=>
The client chooses any of them, after which full information about this service and reviews will be available to him
